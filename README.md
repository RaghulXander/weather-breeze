# A Responsive weather app

The application will utilize openweathermap.org for free API forecast collection and Google Maps API for free search suggestions.
I have designed this by inspiring from the two figma prototype [prototype 1](https://www.figma.com/file/hNG5yDVA0M8Sxndke8W7iV/Weather-Web-App-(Community)?type=design&node-id=1-235&mode=design) [prototype 2](https://www.figma.com/file/Cis9wvgZ3tf6XJfUSphui2/WeatherMe-Website-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)

# Deployment
The code is deployed in the netlify services - https://skylite-weather-breeze.netlify.app/
